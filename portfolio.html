  <h1 id="l1"> Here i will be displaying my skill on creating an html file</h1>
  <br>
  <p title="title trial 1 AKA tooltip"> I will be listing every aspect of my learning as we progress to the finish. Each and every element of this website will be to learn also showcase the skills learned  </p>
  <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kib_rahman/">here is a link to my instagram account</a>
  <br>
  <img src="/images/sunset.webp" alt="picture of a sunset" width="300" height="300">
  <p style="color:red"> here is where I learned about the style attribute.</p>
  <h1>there are 6 different types of headers. Also I will demonstrate the "br" tag
       which is also an empty tag and lets us break into the next line
  <br>this is h1</h1>
  <h2>this is h2</h2>
  <h3>this is h3</h3>
  <h4>this is h4</h4>
  <h5>this is h5</h5>
  <h6>this is h6</h6>
  <p1> html headings and paragraphs have a defult size, but we can also modify the size with the style attribute using CSS <strong>font-size</strong> property</p1>
  <h1 style="font-size: 44;"> we can select our own size, or use the templets like large small medium, or we can use percentages of the default size</h1>
  <p>html removes white spaces from headers or paragraphs unless specified not to do so.</p>
  <hr>
  <p> hr is an empty tag which allows us to draw a horozontal line in the webpage</p>
  <pre>
      the pre element lets us define a pre-formated text
      in this element we can use as many white spaces to as we want to              write 
      and the html will preserve any and all whitespaces       while using this element 
      also indent the texts  which is adjustable by removing or adding  some whitespaces
  </pre>
  <p>the style attribute is to add color, change size, change fonts and others</p>
  <p style="color:aquamarine; font-size: larger; font-family: Times ; background-color: black;">
      this attribute can be used on paragraphs, headings, body, head and so on.</p>
  <p style="font-size: 150%;"> Now i will demonstrate all the different style propertie and value uses in couple of paragraphs</p>
  <p style="font-family: Verdana;"> this line is to practice font-family</p>
  <p> this paragraphs will be filled with differently formated texts like <b> bold</b> <strong>strong</strong> <i>italics</i>
  <em>epmhasized text</em> <mark> marked text</mark> <small> small text</small> <del>deleted texts</del> <ins>inserted texts</ins>
  <sub>subscripts</sub><super> supercripts</super></p>
  <p> now im going to learn about blockquote. blockquote is when an entire paragraph is sited from another source </p>
  <blockquote cite="https://www.nike.com">
      you have to use the cite attribute to specify link. 
      here is where the text goes and the rest of the code is hiddine but also links two pages for the search engines to make a link
  </blockquote>
  <p>now im learning to put quotation marks on paragraphs<q>it is with q in <>`</q></p>
  <p>the next step is to learn how to put abbrivations on the source code.</p>
  <p> to put abbriviations on source is to use the abbr tag with the title attribute in between a paragraph or heading. <abbr title="four to ka one">FTKO</abbr></p>
  <p> the address tag is to mark addresses or contct info. it can be used between praagraphs and headings. </p>
  <address>this is the address bracked. <br>
      we still have to use br to break lines <br>
      but in all honesty it just makes its look like an address label<br>
  </address>
  <p>the cite tag defines the title of a creative work (e.g. a book, a poem, a song, a movie, a painting, a sculpture, etc.) <cite>ahrar nakib</cite> </p>
  <p>If your browser supports bi-directional override (bdo), the next line will be written from right to left (rtl):</p>
  <bdo dir="rtl">This line will be written from right to left</bdo>
  <!-- This is a comment -->
  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  <!-- Comments are not displayed in the browser -->
  <p><a href="#l1">this is a bookmark. bookmarks are case sensitive</a></p>
